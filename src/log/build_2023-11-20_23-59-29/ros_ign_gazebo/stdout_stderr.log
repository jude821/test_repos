[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:32 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findignition-transport10.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "ignition-transport10", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "ignition-transport10" with any of the following names:

    ignition-transport10Config.cmake
    ignition-transport10-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "ignition-transport10" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
See also "/home/ubuntu/robot_ws/src/build/ros_ign_gazebo/CMakeFiles/CMakeOutput.log".
  or set "ignition-transport10_DIR" to a directory containing one of the
  above files.  If "ignition-transport10" provides a separate development
  package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
